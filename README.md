## Simple NextJS v13 with TailwindCSS Posts

Clone the repo and run the development server in case you want to see what is inside.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Note that NextJS 13 is still experimental.

## Observation(s)

When I added the loading.js to app folder, everything worked as supposed on the first page load but subsequent times will cause the page to keep loading for a very long time and you need to restart your server before you can view your page.

## Demo Link

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
